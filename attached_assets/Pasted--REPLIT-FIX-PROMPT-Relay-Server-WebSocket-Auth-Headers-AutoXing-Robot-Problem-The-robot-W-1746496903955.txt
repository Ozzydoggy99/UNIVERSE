âœ… ðŸ”§ REPLIT FIX PROMPT: Relay Server WebSocket Auth Headers (AutoXing Robot)
ðŸš¨ Problem:
The robot WebSocket connection is being closed immediately because it's missing the required authentication headers (x-auth-key, x-auth-secret) as documented by AutoXing.

These must be sent as custom headers during the initial WebSocket handshake, which is not possible directly from the browser.

Since Replit has access to the key and secret already, please inject those headers when the backend relay connects to the robot.

âœ… Objective:
Update the backend relay (relay-server.js) so that when it connects to the robot at:

bash
Copy
Edit
ws://47.180.91.99/websocket/robot/L382502104987ir/pose
â€¦it includes the correct authentication headers.

ðŸ§© File: relay-server.js
Update the connection code to include headers like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server, path: "/ws/pose" });

// Robot WebSocket endpoint
const ROBOT_SERIAL = "L382502104987ir";
const ROBOT_WS_URL = `ws://47.180.91.99/websocket/robot/${ROBOT_SERIAL}/pose`;

// ðŸ‘‡ Replit: you already have the key and secret â€” fill them in here
const ROBOT_AUTH_KEY = "FILL_IN_AUTH_KEY";
const ROBOT_AUTH_SECRET = "FILL_IN_AUTH_SECRET";

wss.on("connection", (clientSocket) => {
  console.log("[Relay] Client connected");

  // Relay connects to robot WS with auth headers
  const robotSocket = new WebSocket(ROBOT_WS_URL, {
    headers: {
      "x-auth-key": ROBOT_AUTH_KEY,
      "x-auth-secret": ROBOT_AUTH_SECRET
    }
  });

  robotSocket.on("open", () => {
    console.log("[Relay] Connected to robot WebSocket");
  });

  robotSocket.on("message", (data) => {
    if (clientSocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      clientSocket.send(data);
    }
  });

  robotSocket.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("[Relay] Robot WebSocket error:", err.message);
  });

  robotSocket.on("close", (code, reason) => {
    console.warn(`[Relay] Robot socket closed: ${code} - ${reason}`);
  });

  clientSocket.on("close", () => {
    console.log("[Relay] Client disconnected");
    robotSocket.close();
  });
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Relay WebSocket Server is running.");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Relay server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
âœ… Result
Replitâ€™s relay now connects to the robot using proper x-auth-key and x-auth-secret headers

The WebSocket session will no longer be rejected or closed

Your frontend will receive live pose updates via the secure wss://.../ws/pose path

ðŸ’¡ Replit: Please remember to securely fill in the correct header values where marked. Let me know if you'd like the headers loaded from a .env file instead.
