Connect to Robot
To control the robot, first we must establish a connection.

There are two ways to connect to the robot:

Connect to the robot with Ethernet RJ45 port. Use http://192.168.25.25:8090.
Connect to the AP of the robot. Use http://192.168.12.1:8090.
In this document, we shall connect to the robot and use 192.168.25.25:8090.

#Authentication
A secure local network is assumed, so we only have a simple HTTP header based authentication. All HTTP requests must have a header Secret.

But for simplicity, in this tutorial, we will not repeat it everywhere.

#First Request: Query Device Info
The following command uses curl to make a HTTP request, and use jq (opens new window)to format the outputï¼š

# The secret is hidden. The real one must be requested.
curl -H "Secret: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" http://192.168.25.25:8090/device/info | jq
TIP

Requests from the following IPs doesn't require a secret.
