✅ Scalable, Multi-Robot Architecture (Using Your Existing System)
🔁 What Stays from Your Code
robot-ws-client.js: real-time bridge (per robot or multiplexed)

robot-client.js: REST fallbacks or batch commands

robot-ai-core.py, task-queue.py: offboard intelligence

robot-ai-web-interface.html OR the React /client/: front-end robot dashboard

Live robot dashboard per physical robot, already working

📦 Replit Startup Prompt (Honors Existing Code Structure)
Here’s a Replit-compatible main.sh that launches everything you already have and keeps it scalable:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

export ROBOT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
export ROBOT_API_HOST="192.168.4.31"
export ROBOT_API_PORT="8090"

echo "🔌 Starting universal multi-robot interface..."

# Start robot manager (connects to many robots via WebSocket)
node robot-manager.js &

# Start dashboard UI (assumes React client already works)
npm install --prefix client
npm run dev --prefix client &

# Start AI modules (modular and scalable per robot)
python3 robot-ai-core.py &
python3 robot-ai-task-queue.py &
🧠 Key Components You’ll Want (If Not Already Built)
✅ robot-manager.js
Responsible for:

Tracking all active robots by serialNumber or robotId

Opening WebSocket connections (or pooling them)

Fetching map/template info via API

Injecting events into your dashboard frontend

Suggested structure:

js
Copy
Edit
const robots = {
  "SN-001": connectToRobot("192.168.4.31"),
  "SN-002": connectToRobot("192.168.4.32"),
  ...
}
✅ robot-router.js
Middleware that routes:

Events from robot → AI handler

Commands from dashboard → robot WebSocket/REST

🌍 In Your Dashboard (Already Built per Robot)
Expand to:

Live map based on odometry or SLAM

Realtime template/zone assignment

Task progress (queue from task-queue.py)

Health & telemetry (battery, sensors, errors)

📋 API & Auth (per your robot's setup)
Every robot call must include:

http
Copy
Edit
x-api-key: <ROBOT_SECRET_KEY>
Whether through axios, requests, or WebSocket headers — this remains consistent and you already have it embedded.
